How to use Image Search(Search Whole Screen) and ImageSearchArea(Search part of the screen):
============================================================================================

• ImageSearch: _ImageSearch($findImage, $resultPosition, ByRef $x, ByRef $y, $tolerance, $transparency)
• ImageSearchArea: _ImageSearchArea($findImage, $resultPosition, $x1, $y1, $right, $bottom, ByRef $x, ByRef $y, $tolerance, $transparency)
 
 Description:      Find the position of an image on the desktop
 Syntax:           _ImageSearchArea, _ImageSearch
 Parameter(s):
                   $findImage - the image to locate on the desktop
                   $resultPosition - Set where the returned x,y location of the image is.
                                     1 for centre of image, 0 for top left of image
				   $x $y - Return the x and y location of the image
				   $tolerance - 0 for no tolerance (0-255). Needed when colors of
                                image differ from desktop. e.g GIF                   
                   $transparency - TRANSBLACK, TRANSWHITE or hex value (e.g. 0xffffff) of
                                  the color to be used as transparency; can be omitted if
                                  not needed
				  
				  
				  Parameters specific to ImageSearchArea:
				   $x1 $y1 - top left coords of the search area
				   $right $bottom - bottom right coords of the search area. Would be the same as $x2 $y2
				  
				   
 Return Value(s):  On Success - Returns True
                   On Failure - Returns False

 Note: Use _ImageSearch to search the entire desktop, _ImageSearchArea to specify
       a desktop region to search



==========================================
How to use WaitForImageSearch (one image)
==========================================

• WaitForImageSearch: _WaitForImageSearch($findImage, $waitSecs, $resultPosition, ByRef $x, ByRef $y, $tolerance, $transparency)

 Description:      Wait for a specified number of seconds for an image to appear

 Syntax:           _WaitForImageSearch, _WaitForImagesSearch
 Parameter(s):
                   $findImage - the image to locate on the desktop
				   $waitSecs  - seconds to try and find the image
				   $resultPosition - Set where the returned x,y location of the image is.
                                     1 for centre of image, 0 for top left of image
                   $x $y - Return the x and y location of the image
				   $tolerance - 0 for no tolerance (0-255). Needed when colors of
                                image differ from desktop. e.g GIF
                   $transparency - TRANSBLACK, TRANSWHITE or hex value (e.g. 0xffffff) of
                                  the color to be used as transparency can be omitted if
                                  not needed

 Return Value(s):  On Success - Returns 1
                   On Failure - Returns 0

How to use WaitForImagesSearch (More than one image)
=====================================================

• WaitForImagesSearch: _WaitForImagesSearch($findImage, $waitSecs, $resultPosition, ByRef $x, ByRef $y, $tolerance, $transparency = 0)

 Description:      Wait for a specified number of seconds for any of a set of
                   images to appear

 Syntax:           _WaitForImagesSearch
 Parameter(s):
					$findImage - the ARRAY of images to locate on the desktop
                              - ARRAY[0] is set to the number of images to loop through
                                ARRAY[1] is the first image
					$waitSecs  - seconds to try and find the image
					$resultPosition - Set where the returned x,y location of the image is.
                                     1 for centre of image, 0 for top left of image
					$x $y - Return the x and y location of the image
					$tolerance - 0 for no tolerance (0-255). Needed when colors of
                                image differ from desktop. e.g GIF
                    $transparent - TRANSBLACK, TRANSWHITE or hex value (e.g. 0xffffff) of
                                  the color to be used as transparent; can be omitted if

 Return Value(s):  On Success - Returns the index of the successful find
                   On Failure - Returns 0
